# pyheck

PyHeck is a case conversion library (for converting strings to snake_case, camelCase etc). It is a thin wrapper around the Rust library [heck](https://github.com/withoutboats/heck).

```
pip install pyheck
```

>>> snake("We carry a new world here, in our hearts.")
'we_carry_a_new_world_here_in_our_hearts'

```

## Development

### Setup

2. Install dev dependencies:

```
poetry install
```

3. Activate the poetry shell:

```

### Testing
